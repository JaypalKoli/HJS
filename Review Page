        If you are looking for a super bike to go on long stretches,
        i think this is the one to consider. I have rode really long distances close to 800 kms in 12 hours.
        This gives you utmost comfort and confidence to ride on indian roads. The power at disposal boosts
        the confidence to take easy overtaking. In simple words you get a quality superbike for the money you 
        pay and on top of it I feel taking th e pride of owning an world renowned Iconic brand which has a lot 
        of history to it. Many dream of owning one and I owe one of it.

        Hello friends, I own CBR 250 R which comes from the premium sports bike series of Honda CBR. The main 
        attractions include full front fairing and sporty rear end. Of course its 250cc four stroke liquid cooled 
        engine makes it a perfect bike for the speed freaks. It has a diamond frame with TUSS structure. Its seat 
        is split form which makes it look stunning. It has combined anti-lock braking system that makes its braking
        system very effective. It has been a year I am driving it and I have not faced any issues so far.

        its milage is low. if you have enough money to buy it and can efford it fuel money this bike is made for you.
        This is sports bike and its look is killer. KTM RC 200 has a good pickup speed that none another 200cc bikes will have.
        Ktm duke is powerful bike. I love my first ride on it. Its gear, suspension, acceleration are excellent but its average 
        is low. Ktm company should work on bike average. But its not a big deal. All over bike is very good.

        The bobber: stripped down, simple, and solo-saddled. Such is the 2020 Indian Scout Bobber Sixty. Understated with blacked-out 
        details, this cruiser is void of glistening chrome, valanced fenders, or fringe. The brushed aluminum block lettering plainly 
        laid out on the side of the tank and brushed metal veins on the engine are the only shining details that draw the eye. Although 
        it is one of the smallest-displacement Scouts from Indian, the Scout Bobber Sixty is still brawny, yet approachable.
